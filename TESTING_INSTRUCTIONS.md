## 1. Download & Installation (Android)
Please download the APK file from the public Google Drive link below:

**📥 Download APK**: [INSERT_GOOGLE_DRIVE_LINK_HERE]

> **Note**: Since this is a direct APK download, you may need to allow **"Install from Unknown Sources"** in your browser or file manager settings when prompted.

## 2. Test Credentials
Please use the following pre-configured account to log in and explore the app's full functionality:

- **Email**: `[INSERT_EMAIL_HERE]`

## 3. Setup Guide
Once installed and logged in, the app will guide you through the setup:
1.  **Enable Keyboard**: Toggle "Typira" in your system's "On-screen keyboard" settings.
2.  **Select Keyboard**: Switch your active input method to Typira.
3.  **Grant Permissions**: Accept necessary permissions (e.g., Overlay) for the AI assistant to function correctly.

## 4. What to Test
Here are the core features we recommend trying out:

### ⌨️ Smart Keyboard
- Open any app (WhatsApp, Notes, Slack) and start typing with Typira.
- Observe how the keyboard feels and reacts.

### 🧠 AI Assistance
- **Tap the Typira Icon** on the keyboard toolbar to open the AI assistant.
- **Rewrite**: Type a rough sentence, select it, and choose a tone (Professional, Casual, etc.).
- **Translate**: Try typing in one language and translating it instantly.
- **Ask AI**: Use the chat interface to ask questions without leaving your current app.

### 📊 Insights Dashboard
