    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 3, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to Typira ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a
        positive experience on our mobile application and related services (collectively, the "Service").</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the
        Typira keyboard and mobile application. Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding
        your data.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>🚨 Important Note on Keyboard "Full Access" (iOS)</h3>
        <p>To function as an intelligent AI assistant, Typira requires "Full Access" to be enabled in your iOS settings.
            This is a technical requirement by Apple for custom keyboards to access the internet. We use this permission
            for exactly two purposes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>AI Processing & Memory:</strong> To send the text segments you type to our secure servers. This
                allows us to provide real-time rewriting suggestions, grammar checks, and build a personalized "Memory"
                of your context/style to assist you better.</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar Integration:</strong> To access your device's calendar events <em>only when you
                    explicitly request it</em> (e.g., "Schedule a meeting for tomorrow") to check availability or create
                events.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Strict Privacy Commitment:</strong> We do NOT use "Full Access" to log your passwords or credit card
            numbers. The iOS system automatically disables Typira in password fields ("Secure Text Entry"), ensuring we
            never see sensitive credentials.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users. The types of information we collect include:
    </p>

    <h3>A. Information You Provide to Us</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register for Typira, we collect your name, email address, and
            password (hashed).</li>
        <li><strong>User Content (Typing Data):</strong> As you use the Typira keyboard, we collect and process the text
            you type. This data is transmitted to our servers to:

                <li>Generate real-time AI suggestions and corrections.</li>
                <li>Build your "Contextual Memory" (e.g., remembering your tone, project details, or frequent topics) to
                    personalize future suggestions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Calendar Data:</strong> If you use scheduling features, we access event details (title, time,
            attendees) to perform the requested action.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymous information about how you use the app, such as features

            model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Delivery:</strong> To operate the keyboard, generate AI responses, and manage your account.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> To remember your writing style and context (via the "Memory" feature) so
            the AI becomes more helpful over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> To analyze usage trends and improve the accuracy of our AI models.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To send you updates, security alerts, and support messages.</li>

        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share data with trusted third-party vendors (e.g., cloud hosting
            providers, AI processing engines) who assist us in operating the Service. These partners are bound by strict
            confidentiality agreements.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid
            requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).</li>

                    context, and learned metadata) at any time via the <strong>Settings > Clear AI Memory</strong>
                    option in the app. This resets your AI profile while keeping your account active.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You can delete your entire account and all associated data at any
                    time via <strong>Settings > Account Deletion</strong>.</li>
