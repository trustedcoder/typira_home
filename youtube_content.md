## Video Description

**Never miss a promise again.**

It started with a heartbreak—a missed graduation party because a chat promise never made it to a calendar. We realized our phones are smart, but they don't actually *understand* us. They watch us type thousands of words of intent, yet they let those moments slip through the cracks of the "App Gap."

**Meet Typira.**

Typira isn't just a keyboard; it's a proactive AI agent that lives where you do. Powered by Google Gemini 3, Typira transforms the most utilized tool on your device into a context-aware orchestrator that bridges the gap between intent and action.

### 🚀 Key Features:
*   **🧠 Passive Context Building:** Typira learns from your daily context to build a dynamic, private "User Bio." It understands your projects, your tone, and even your stress levels.
*   **⚡ Proactive Orchestration:** Forget app-switching. If you mention a meeting, Typira offers to schedule it. Mention a place, and it's ready to navigate. It proactively unblocks your workflow across every app.
*   **👁️ Multimodal Intelligence:** Speak or snap a photo directly from the keyboard. Typira uses Gemini’s multimodal power to extract meaning and trigger deep-link actions instantly.
*   **👻 The Ghost Agent:** Even when you aren't typing, our backend processes your history to surface relevant news, missed tasks, and personalized insights as actionable notifications.

### 🛠️ Built With:
*   **AI:** Google Gemini 3 & Gemini Flash 2.0 (Preview)
*   **Frontend:** Flutter & Dart (iOS/Android)
*   **Backend:** Python (Flask), Flask-SocketIO, & APScheduler
*   **Integrations:** Firebase (FCM), MySQL, & a library of Deep Link Orchestrations

Typira is our submission for the **Google Gemini Hackathon**. We’re redefining the keyboard from a passive input tool into an active partner that ensures when you say "I'll be there," your phone actually makes it happen.

**Experience the future of mobile agency.**
